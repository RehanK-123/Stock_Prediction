# Stock_Prediction

This is a basic machine learning predictive model implemented through a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Model, Python, Numpy, Pandas and Flask with HTML for the front end. Here we have taken the dataset Dominos.csv stocks and used the adjusted close price and the opening price of the stocks to predict the next days closing price stock, the model takes in a date as an input from the user, and uses the past values preceding the inputted date to predict the price of the stock on that date.
